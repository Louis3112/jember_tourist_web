The project is my first web development project using simple HTML and CSS.

The project is a website page provide an overview of tourist attractions in Jember, town of my hometown

The places are:
1. Papuma Cape____________ *(Tanjung Papuma)*
2. Watu Ulo Beach__________ *(Pantai Watu Ulo)*
3. Love Bay_________________ *(Teluk Love)*
4. Tancak Waterfall_________ *(Air Terjun Tancak)*
5. J88 Hill__________________ *(Bukit J88)*
6. Skyland Paragliding_____ *(Paralayang Skyland)*

Each place have :
- Unique information about the attraction
- Distance from *Alun-alun Jember*
- Road/track conditions with visual indicators. The harder the track, the color indicator will chage

The primary color palette we are using are :
1. #822bb2
2. #FFFFFF
3. #000000
4. #efc3fd

The project was originally completed in December 2023. Itâ€™s a simple and nostalgic project that I want to preserve as a memory.
